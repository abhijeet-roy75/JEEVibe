**Competitor Reality:**
- All major players offer full-length mock tests
- NTA Abhyas (free) offers official mock tests
- Students expect this for JEE prep

**Impact:**
- **High**: Students need realistic exam simulation

- Should include: 3-hour timer, 90 questions, marking scheme, detailed analysis
- Free tier: 1/month is reasonable
- Pro tier: 5/month is competitive
- Ultra: Unlimited is good differentiator

---

**Competitor Reality:**
- All major players have extensive PYQ banks
- MARKS App (free) has 1+ lakh PYQs
- Students highly value PYQs for exam preparation

**Impact:**

**Recommendation:**
- **Priority 2**: Consider adding video lessons
- Options:
  1. Partner with content creators
  2. Create curated playlists from YouTube
  3. Build own video library (expensive)
- Ultra-only gating is reasonable
- Can differentiate with "AI-personalized video recommendations"

---

### 4. Live Classes (LOW Priority)

**Current Status**: Not planned

**Competitor Reality:**
- Unacademy, Vedantu, BYJU'S offer live classes
- PhysicsWallah offers some live batches
