13. Assumptions & Constraints
13.1 Assumptions
Technical Assumptions:
   1. Grok API will be available with acceptable rate limits (100 calls/user/day minimum)
   2. Firebase free tier sufficient for 100 users, Blaze plan for 1,000+
   3. 90% of target users have Android 8.0+ devices
   4. Average 3G/4G internet speed: 2-5 Mbps
   5. Razorpay will process payments within 24 hours
Business Assumptions:
   1. Target users (JEE aspirants) own smartphones (95%+ penetration)
   2. Parents willing to give consent for minors (90%+ approval rate)
   3. 25-35% conversion from Free to Pro tier (based on PhysicsWallah benchmark)
   4. Average subscription lifetime: 6-8 months (until JEE Main exam)
   5. Organic growth possible via word-of-mouth + referrals
User Behavior Assumptions:
   1. Students will practice 5-7 days per week (not daily)
   2. Average session length: 15-20 minutes
   3. 60% of users will use Snap & Solve feature
   4. 40% of users will take chapter mocks
   5. Churn peaks in June-July (post Board exams, before JEE prep season)
Regulatory Assumptions:
   1. DPDP Rules 2025 enforcement begins May 2027 (we have 18 months buffer)
   2. Government will not ban EdTech apps (like China's policy)
   3. Parental consent via SMS is legally sufficient until DigiLocker mandatory
   4. Grok API data processing in US is DPDP-compliant with proper disclosure
________________


13.2 Constraints
Timeline Constraints:
   * Hard deadline: 16 weeks for MVP (by March 2026)
   * Cannot extend: JEE Main 2026 is in April, must launch in March for relevance
   * Dependency: Grok API access must be confirmed by Week 2
Budget Constraints:
   * Total MVP budget: ₹15L (infrastructure + compliance + content)
   * Monthly burn (post-launch): ₹50K for 100 users, ₹5L for 10,000 users
   * Break-even: Need 3,000 Pro users (₹3L MRR) to cover costs
Resource Constraints:
   * Team size: 3 founders (1 CEO, 1 CTO, 1 Ops)
   * No full-time hires until funding or revenue
   * CTO availability: Part-time (20-30 hours/week) during MVP phase
   * Content creation: CEO handles initial 500 questions manually
Technology Constraints:
   * Android only (iOS development requires 3+ months additional)
   * Firebase limitations:
   * Firestore: 1 million reads/day on free tier
   * Cloud Functions: 2 million invocations/month on free tier
   * Grok API: Rate limits unknown, must have fallback
   * No custom server: Relying entirely on Firebase (serverless architecture)
Regulatory Constraints:
   * Cannot launch without parental consent mechanism
   * Cannot track minors for advertising (DPDP Act)
   * Must provide data deletion within 48 hours of request
   * Must store payment records for 7 years (legal requirement)
Market Constraints:
   * High competition: PhysicsWallah, Unacademy, Vedantu already established
   * Seasonality: JEE enrollment peaks Aug-Sep (Class 11 starts), Jan-Feb (pre-exam panic)
   * Price sensitivity: Indian students expect low-cost or free solutions
   * Trust barrier: New brand, must establish credibility quickly
